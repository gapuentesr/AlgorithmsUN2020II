<h1>Algorithms for Coding Interviews in Python</h1>

<h2>Percentage of progress in the course: 40%</h2>


At the beginning of the course, an introduction to algorithmic paradigms such as:
- Brute force.
- Greedy algorithms.
- Divide and conquer.
- Dynamic programming.

Then a review of the asymptotic analysis and some application examples in real codes are developed.

Finally, study some classification and search algorithms as well as some challenges that the course proposes to better understand their application.
