The major bit here is tabulation. If we are able to tabulate the problem properly we will be able to solve the problem with bottom-up dynamic programming. If you look at the visualization of the recursive algorithm, you would notice how each recursive call takes count of previously matched consecutive characters of both strings. This gives us some idea of what we need to tabulate. We can have a 2-d array of size mxn, where any position is given by i^(th) row and j^(th) column gives us the maximum count of character matches between the first string up to i^(th) position and the second string up to j^(th) position.
