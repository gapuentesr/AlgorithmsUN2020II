Nothing else. Now that we are evaluating our Fibonacci numbers from the start, we may not need to store all preceding terms for higher Fibonacci numbers. This means that we only need to store the answer to Fib(4) to compute Fib(5) and Fib(6). Fib(7)or any other later numbers do not require the answer to Fib(4). Thus, instead of maintaining the state of all the n-1 previous Fibonacci numbers, if we maintain the values of only the last two preceding numbers, our algorithm will run fine.
