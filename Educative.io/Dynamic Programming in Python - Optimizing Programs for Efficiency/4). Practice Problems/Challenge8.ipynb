There can be three kinds of operations: i) insertion of a character at some specific position, ii) deletion of a character at some specific position, or iii) changing a character at some specific position into some other character. The visualization below shows all these operations. Each operation has a cost of one unit. Thus, you want to find the minimum cost of converting str1 into str2. The following visualization also shows how different sequences of operations can entail different costs.\r\n","\r\n","Note: This problem has a direct application in the autocorrect feature.\r\n","\r\n","The alignment depiction in the above visualization is a hint towards the solution. You basically need to find an alignment between two strings that has the least cost. When characters match, there is no cost, but there is a cost of one unit when characters do not match, or when a character is skipped in either of the strings\r\n","\r\n","> **Input**\r\n","\r\n","Your algorithm will take as input two strings, str1 and str2.\r\n","\r\n","str1 = \"teh\"\r\n","\r\n","str2 = \"the\"\r\n","\r\n","> **Output**\r\n","\r\n","Your algorithm should output the minimum cost of converting str1 into str2 or minimum cost of aligning both strings.\r\n","\r\n","editDistance(\"teh\", \"the\") = 2\r\n","\r\n","> **Coding challenge**\r\n","\r\n","Hopefully, the above visualization will give you some hint about the solution. However, think about some examples and convince yourself how aligning them returns the edit distance. Then think about a way to align two strings."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"X6F48ZMQpE7-"},"source":["> **Solution #1: Simple recursion**\r\n","\r\n","\r\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"LRyPN19aVo7b","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1608138038215,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":880,"user":{"displayName":"Gustavo Alberto Puentes Romero","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjqQBh_ZAtuAAMd4oGBKipKUivhhNcGMBq9GsO0hQ=s64","userId":"01025807188050505264"}},"outputId":"51a1e9e7-872b-4180-ee2a-16560d4935c6"},"source":["def editDistanceRecurse(str1, str2, i, j):\r\n","    if i == len(str1):  # base case of reaching the end of str1\r\n","        return len(str2) - j\r\n","    \r\n","    if j == len(str2):  # base case of reaching the end of str2\r\n","        return len(str1) - i\r\n","    \r\n","    if str1[i] == str2[j]:  # if the characters match, we move ahead\r\n","        return editDistanceRecurse(str1, str2, i+1, j+1)\r\n","    # if characters don't match\r\n","    return 1 + min(editDistanceRecurse(str1, str2, i+1, j+1),   # we can change characters\r\n","                   editDistanceRecurse(str1, str2, i, j+1),     # we can have an insertion in str1 (or skip a character in str1)\r\n","                   editDistanceRecurse(str1, str2, i+1, j))     # we can have a deletion in str1 (or skip a character in str2)\r\n","\r\n","def editDistance(str1, str2):\r\n","    return editDistanceRecurse(str1, str2, 0, 0)\r\n","\r\n","print(editDistance(\"teh\", \"the\"))"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["2\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zjRlbrQqjm9t"},"source":["> **Solution #2: Top-down dynamic programming**\r\n","\r\n","\r\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NyQPdF9ZPLJA"},"source":["Let’s first see how this problem satisfies both prerequisites for applying dynamic programming.\r\n","\r\n","**Optimal substructure**\r\n","\r\n","The optimal answer for a pair of strings of size nn and mm can be found by using the following:\r\n","\r\n","*   Optimal answer to the subproblem of substrings of sizes n-1 and m-1 formed by removing the first characters.\r\n","*   Optimal answer to the subproblem of keeping the first string as it is (size of n) and removing the first character of the second string (size of m-1).\r\n","*   Optimal answer to the subproblem of keeping the second string as it is (size of m) and removing the first character of the first string (size of n-1).\r\n","\r\n","Since we can break down the main problem in terms of specific subproblems, this problem has an optimal substructure.\r\n","\r\n","**Overlapping subproblem**\r\n","\r\n","So, this shows that we can benefit from memoization.
