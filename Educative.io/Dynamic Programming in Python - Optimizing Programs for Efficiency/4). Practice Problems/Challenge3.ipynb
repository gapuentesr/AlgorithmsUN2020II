Each class, c, is characterized by its start time, end time, and total utility we can get out of this class. The utility here could be the number of attendants of the class; the more attendants, the more money you can make as an auditorium owner. Here is your problem statement:\r\n","\r\n","Given n number of classes, you have to find a schedule that maximizes the utility of an auditorium.\r\n","\r\n","\r\n","> **Input**\r\n","\r\n","A list of classes, where each class is a tuple of three numbers.
