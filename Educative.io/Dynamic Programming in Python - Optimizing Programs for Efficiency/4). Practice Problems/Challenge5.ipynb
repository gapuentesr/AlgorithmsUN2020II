All of the cities are connected directly to each other via distinct routes of variable lengths. You, being a salesman, have to travel to each of these cities on a business trip. But your company wants you to be very careful with the travel expenses and wants you to spend the least amount possible. Expenditure is a function of the distance traveled, so you want to minimize the total distance traveled. Find the length of the shortest path to travel all the cities.\r\n","\r\n","> **Input**\r\n","\r\n","You will be given a 2-d matrix, distances, of size n \\times nn×n denoting the distance between all the cities. To check the distance from i^(th) city to j^(th) city, you can simply do distances[i][j]. The matrix does not necessarily have to be symmetrical, i.e., distances[i][j] ≠ distances[j][i]. You can start from any city to travel around all the other cities until you come back to the same city you started traveling from. You should not visit any city twice other than the first city.\r\n","\r\n","distances = [\r\n","\r\n","      [0, 10, 20],\r\n","\r\n","      [12, 0, 10],\r\n","\r\n","      [19, 11, 0]\r\n","\r\n","]\r\n","\r\n","> **Output**\r\n","\r\n","Your algorithm should return the minimum distance traveled to traverse every city; each city other than the first.

As the order in which cities are visited is not important as long as all the cities are visited, unordered sets are a perfect fit for the problem.
