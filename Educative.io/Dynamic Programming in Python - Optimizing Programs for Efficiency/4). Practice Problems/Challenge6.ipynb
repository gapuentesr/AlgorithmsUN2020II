A common subsequence in a pair of strings is a sequence that follows the same order of characters, but the sequence does not necessarily have to be contiguous. For example, two strings two and too have a common subsequence of to. Even though to does not appear contiguously in two, the order of characters is still preserved, i.e., o follows t. While these strings had smaller subsequences as well, such as t and o, in the context of this problem, we are only interested in finding the length of the longest subsequence.\r\n","\r\n","> **Input**\r\n","\r\n","Your algorithm will take two strings, i.e., str1 and str2, as input. Strings can be of variable length, even empty too.\r\n","\r\n","str1 = \"two\"\r\n","\r\n","str2 = \"too\"\r\n","\r\n","> **Output**\r\n","\r\n","Your algorithm should return an integer representing the length of the longest common subsequence.\r\n","\r\n","LCS(\"two\", \"too\") = 2\r\n","\r\n","> **Coding challenge**\r\n","\r\n","You have already solved a similar problem of the longest common substring in the previous chapter.
