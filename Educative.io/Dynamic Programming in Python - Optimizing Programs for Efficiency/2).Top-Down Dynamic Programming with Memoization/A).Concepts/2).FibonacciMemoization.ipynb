We can use either a list or dictionary for memoization in this problem. In this course, we will use a dictionary because it is more convenient than a list. The only changes we are going to make to our original Fibonacci algorithm is the addition and usage of this new dictionary. We have defined a dictionary globally so it is available to all the fib() calls (line 1). Next, after the base cases, we check whether this number has already been evaluated, if it was, its memoized value is returned (lines 8-9). Otherwise, we need to evaluate this result, and this is where we make the recursive call (lines 11-12). Here before returning, we memoize the result in memo[n]. We do not need to memoize base cases as they are already usually O(1) operations."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"1LA5NNIe9_Oa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1608045351373,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":627,"user":{"displayName":"Gustavo Alberto Puentes Romero","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjqQBh_ZAtuAAMd4oGBKipKUivhhNcGMBq9GsO0hQ=s64","userId":"01025807188050505264"}},"outputId":"47dd690a-cc8f-426e-dba9-f3f5acf0070d"},"source":["memo = {} #dictionay for Memoization\r\n","\r\n","def fib(n):\r\n","  if n == 0: # base case 1\r\n","    return 0\r\n","  if n == 1: # base case 2\r\n","    return 1\r\n","  elif n in memo: # Check if result for n has already been evaluated\r\n","    return memo[n] # return the result if it is available\r\n","  else: # otherwise recursive step\r\n","    memo[n] = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) # store the result of n in memoization dictionary\r\n","    return memo[n] # return the value\r\n","\r\n","print (fib(100))"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["354224848179261915075\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uWiZ_o6--QXn"},"source":["<h1>Time complexity</h1>\r\n","\r\n","Notice how you can now run much bigger numbers as well. This is the benefit of memoization; now we do not need to recalculate fib() calls because their results have been stored through memoization. This reduces the time complexity of our algorithm from O(2^n) to O(n). This is because to evaluate fib(n) we need the result of fib(n-1), and fib(n-2), fib(n-2) would already be evaluated from fib(n-1)'s recursive call, thus its value will be available to fib(n) in O(1). If you continue this, you will see how the second recursive call for all the subsequent calls is always O(1). Only the first call will need to reach the base case, which will make it a simple linear structure instead of a tree. Look at the following visualization."]}]}
