Hashtables are arrays that can be indexed using variable types other than integers. As we have already seen, we may need to store results against strings, floats, and even objects. Hashtables allow us to do all of this quite easily. The only condition for using hashtables is that keys should be unique. In Python, we can use the dictionary data structure as a hash table. The dictionary allows us to store data in the form of key-value pairs in an unordered collection of data values. The code snippet below shows the usage of a dictionary in Python."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Of5dCmkLMnMD","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1608044975403,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":898,"user":{"displayName":"Gustavo Alberto Puentes Romero","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjqQBh_ZAtuAAMd4oGBKipKUivhhNcGMBq9GsO0hQ=s64","userId":"01025807188050505264"}},"outputId":"c3a28599-8f59-443a-e6f1-ac3659999b5b"},"source":["# You create an empty dictionary using curly brackets\r\n","dictionary = {}\r\n","\r\n","key = 1\r\n","value = \"abcd\"\r\n","\r\n","# To add value against a key in the dictionary, do this\r\n","\r\n","dictionary[key] = value\r\n","#or\r\n","dictionary[2] = \"abc\"\r\n","\r\n","# keys and values can be anything, from integers to strings to custom objects\r\n","\r\n","dictionary[\"hello\"] = \"hi\"\r\n","dictionary[1.1] = 1\r\n","\r\n","# A custom class\r\n","class Dummy:\r\n","  def __init__(self, val):\r\n","    self.val = val\r\n","\r\n","# A custom class's object\r\n","customObject = Dummy(5)\r\n","dictionary[customObject] = 5\r\n","\r\n","# To iterate over dictionary do this\r\n","for k,v in dictionary.items():\r\n","  print (k,\":\",v)"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["1 : abcd\n","2 : abc\n","hello : hi\n","1.1 : 1\n","<__main__.Dummy object at 0x7f8a9ce06400> : 5\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zGJWUL0k817a"},"source":["In some cases, you can also use simple lists instead of dictionaries, like in the Fibonacci numbers algorithm.
