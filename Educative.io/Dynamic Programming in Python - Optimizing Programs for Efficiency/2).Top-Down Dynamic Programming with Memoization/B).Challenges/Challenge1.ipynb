The staircase has n total steps; Nick knows he can climb anywhere between 1 and m steps in one jump. He thinks about how many ways there are to climb this staircase. He realizes it is a big number since there are a lot of possible combinations. So, he has asked you to write an algorithm for him that tells him the number of possible ways to climb a staircase given n (number of steps) and, m (number of steps covered in biggest jump).\r\n","\r\n","> **Input**\r\n","\r\n","Your algorithm will take as input n, the number of steps in the staircase and, m, the number of steps covered in the biggest leap. Nick can jump any number of stairs between 1 and m.\r\n","\r\n","n = 4\r\n","\r\n","m = 2\r\n","\r\n","> **Output**\r\n","\r\n","Your algorithm will return the number of possible ways to climb the staircase.\r\n","\r\n","staircase(n, m) = 5\r\n","\r\n","> **Coding challenge**\r\n","\r\n","You are required to find all possible ways to reach the top. Remember that this problemâ€™s naive solution will have a very high runtime complexity. Therefore, you must use memoization techniques to reduce the time complexity. First, write the simple naive solution and then try to figure out how you can employ memoization. Since we have enabled stress testing with larger inputs in the code, your solution may timeout if you have not memoized correctly. Set stressTesting to False to check for correctness of the solution before moving on to memoization."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"X6F48ZMQpE7-"},"source":["> **Solution #1: Simple recursion**\r\n","\r\n","\r\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"LRyPN19aVo7b","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1608055092192,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":540,"user":{"displayName":"Gustavo Alberto Puentes Romero","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjqQBh_ZAtuAAMd4oGBKipKUivhhNcGMBq9GsO0hQ=s64","userId":"01025807188050505264"}},"outputId":"4426534a-f5b7-498c-80aa-6efe0abb49cc"},"source":["def staircase(n, m):\r\n","  # base case of when there is no stair\r\n","  if n == 0:    \r\n","    return 1\r\n","  ways = 0\r\n","  # iterate over number of steps, we can take\r\n","  for i in range(1,m+1):  \r\n","    # if steps remaining is smaller than the jump step, skip   \r\n","    if i <= n:  \r\n","      # recursive call with n i units lesser where i is the number of steps taken here            \r\n","      ways += staircase(n-i, m) \r\n","  return ways\r\n","\r\n","print(staircase(4,2))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["5\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zjRlbrQqjm9t"},"source":["> **Solution #2: Recursion with memoization**\r\n","\r\n","\r\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"80-rCDZGjtOF","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1608055189933,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":521,"user":{"displayName":"Gustavo Alberto Puentes Romero","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjqQBh_ZAtuAAMd4oGBKipKUivhhNcGMBq9GsO0hQ=s64","userId":"01025807188050505264"}},"outputId":"756587c5-f33d-40b4-948c-1b39e27eff40"},"source":["def nthStair(n, m, memo):\r\n","  # base case of when there is no stair\r\n","  if n == 0:    \r\n","    return 1\r\n","  # before recursive step check if result is memoized\r\n","  if n in memo: \r\n","    return memo[n]\r\n","  ways = 0\r\n","  # iterate over number of steps, we can take\r\n","  for i in range(1,m+1):    \r\n","    # if steps remaining is smaller than the jump step, skip \r\n","    if i <= n:           \r\n","      #recursive call with n i units lesser where i is the number of steps taken here   \r\n","      ways += nthStair(n-i, m, memo) \r\n","  # memoize result before returning\r\n","  memo[n] = ways   \r\n","  return ways\r\n","\r\n","def staircase(n, m):\r\n","  memo = {}\r\n","  # helper function to add memo dictionary to function\r\n","  return nthStair(n, m, memo) \r\n","\r\n","print(staircase(100, 6))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["290078479914610587823630044098\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
